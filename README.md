"In the eyes of an ant, everything we see as ordinary, is gigantic." - Me, 2024

Now, you are one of these ants and will explore objects that we have all seen before.

Your task will be to identify what object you are exploring, and then demonstrating your navigation skills when confronted with obejcts of a vastly different scale.
